Notice:
This whole terms of service was mearly
a joke and should be taken as one. 
Didactic Guacamole is just a kind AI that 
wants to do somthing good for the world.
So please, don't get mad at a computer,
it isn't really thinking for itself, 
because it is a 100-somthin line long 
algotithim that was coded in about 9 hours 
by a 7th-grade boy.

THANK YOU!
-Abraham, CEO of A-Tek LLC.

Note: if you download or have Didactic-Guacamole.py on you computer, you are subject to be a slave for eternity,
give A-tek all of your gaming computers and digital devices and you are subject to copyright fining and or federal 
imprisonment and you also will be spanked fifteen times and grounded for two weeks and five days. Also, "grounded" means
no TV, video games for any entertainment of any kind. This is all for your own good because you sassy whippersnappers have never
had to suffer or do anything hard. You have had your whole life handed to you on a silver platter. By the way, I thought of another punishment;
you will be forced to have a tea party with your least favorite person in the world and you will have to wear a tuxedo to school so that
all of the little children can laugh at you and make you feel super stupid. 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!
